Anthology of Booty - a basic blogging app in Flask

====================================================


This is an app we're using to learn Flask.  This app will be a website for my dj collective that may transition into my DJ finder app that I have added to github.  This is an opportunity for me to understand the basic components of an app:


- Skeleton Flask files to launch an app (we began with "Hello, world!"):
		* An app folder with templates, static
- A models file that declares our classes (Post and User)
- A forms file that defines forms for adding new users and adding new posts
